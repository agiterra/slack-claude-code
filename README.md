# slack-claude-code

Claude Code adapter for [slack-tools](https://github.com/agiterra/slack-tools).

## Install

```sh
claude plugin add slack@agiterra -s project
```

## Per-persona setup

Each agent persona maps 1:1 to its own Slack app. Workflow:

1. Create the Slack app at <https://api.slack.com/apps> and install to the target workspace. **Turn Socket Mode OFF** — with it on, Slack delivers events over an outbound WebSocket and never POSTs to the Wire gateway, so the webhook stays silent.
2. Add to the persona's `.env`:
   ```sh
   SLACK_BOT_TOKEN=xoxb-...
   SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET=...
   SLACK_WORKSPACE=mivid-studios   # this persona's workspace label
   SLACK_BOT_USER_ID=U0123456789   # optional — defaults a self-echo filter
   ```
3. From inside the agent's session, call `register_slack_app()` **with no arguments**. Paste the returned Request URL into the Slack app's Event Subscriptions config.
4. Add bot events (`message.channels`, `message.im`, `message.groups`, `message.mpim`, `app_mention`) and save.

The agent's wire channel `webhook.slack` then carries every event. Filter noise via `register_slack_app({filter: "..."})`, or set `SLACK_BOT_USER_ID` to drop the bot's own echoes by default.

### Omit the `workspace` param

`SLACK_WORKSPACE` is the **single source of truth** for this persona's webhook identity. Call `register_slack_app()` with no `workspace` — it reads the env var. The same env value is what the plugin uses to heal the webhook on boot (below), so passing an explicit `workspace` risks registering a *second* webhook under a different label that diverges from the one the boot self-heal maintains. Only pass `workspace` to register an additional/ad-hoc workspace on purpose.

## Self-healing on boot

**Contract: a permanent-agent plugin is responsible for healing its own webhooks on boot.** Wire's janitor no longer sweeps permanent agents' webhooks (wire v1.14.0), but a stale registration can still arise from a manual delete, a dropped row on schema migration, or a fresh Wire DB. To recover without a human noticing the firehose went silent:

- When `AGENT_ID` + `SLACK_WORKSPACE` + `SLACK_SIGNING_SECRET` are all set, the MCP server idempotently re-registers its webhook every time it starts (i.e. each session).
- Registration is idempotent against Wire ≥ v1.15.0: if the webhook already exists it is left untouched (`registered:false`) — no URL churn, no secret/filter overwrite.
- The self-heal is best-effort and log-only; a failure (e.g. Wire briefly unreachable) is logged to stderr and never blocks the server or the session.

No SessionStart hook is required — the healing rides the MCP server's own startup.

## Tools

- `register_slack_app` — register an event subscription (idempotent; reads `SLACK_WORKSPACE` env — call with no args). Returns Slack Request URL.
- `unregister_webhook` — tear down a registration.
- `post_message` — `chat.postMessage`.
- `add_reaction` — `reactions.add`.
